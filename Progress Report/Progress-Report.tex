\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Bikesharing systems are an increasingly popular solution in major urban
areas to increase trips taken by bike, which can help people get around
without cars, thus improving the lives of both users, as well as
non-users, as each bike trip potentially represents a trip that would
otherwise have required a car. We hope to use data from the DC Capital
Bikeshare in 2011 and 2012 to predict bikeshare usage system-wide.

The purpose of this analysis is to determine variables/factors that help
estimate bikeshare useage and develop a model that predicts bikeshare
useage based on certain predictor variables.

\hypertarget{current-status-of-the-project}{%
\section{Current Status of the
Project}\label{current-status-of-the-project}}

Currently, the dataset has undergone exploratory data analysis and data
cleaning. We've identified predictors that may impact a potential
model's goodness of fit and converted some variables into categorical
variables.

\hypertarget{data-cleaning-and-preprocessing}{%
\subsection{Data Cleaning and
Preprocessing}\label{data-cleaning-and-preprocessing}}

The dataset has required minimal cleaning. We had to convert several
variables into factor variables (season, holiday, weekday, workingday,
weather). Additionally we noted that the data key for our dataset
mislabeled the season factor variable, which was trivial to correct.

\hypertarget{eda-visualization}{%
\subsection{EDA / Visualization}\label{eda-visualization}}

Not all of our predictors or response variables are distributed
normally. In particular, humidity exhibits leftward skew, and windspeed
exhibits rightward skew.

Casual users exhibit rightward skew, while registered users are not too
far from the normal distribution.

Preliminary EDA reveals strong seasonality - overall usage on a daily
basis is much higher in spring/summer than fall and much more than
winter.

We wanted to look at the overall bike usage as it relates to
seasonality. We had the hypothesis that we would have more users in the
summer than in the winter. Looking at the plot below, we can see that
not only do we have the max bike usage during the summer, but we also
seem to have an increase to bike usage as the service becomes more
mature.

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{Progress-Report_files/figure-latex/seasonality_daily_usage-1} \end{center}

The next thing we wanted to take a look at is see whether the day of the
week had a large impact on the total bike usage. This is important to
see whether a specific day will have the majority of usage or if they
are relatively evenly spread out. Ideally we want to see the data spread
out. This would allow us to increase on the capitalization of renting
our bikes every day.

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{Progress-Report_files/figure-latex/weekday_usage-1} \end{center}

Next, let's verify these findings by conducting an ANOVA and pairwise
analysis.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{model }\OtherTok{=} \FunctionTok{aov}\NormalTok{(df\_h}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{total\_count }\SpecialCharTok{\textasciitilde{}}\NormalTok{ df\_h}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{season, }\AttributeTok{data =}\NormalTok{ df\_h)}
\FunctionTok{summary}\NormalTok{(model)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
##                Df    Sum Sq  Mean Sq F value Pr(>F)    
## df_h$season     3  37729358 12576453   409.2 <2e-16 ***

## ---
## Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1
\end{verbatim}

The p-value of the F-statistic for season is very small and
statistically significant.At least one group mean is different from the
rest.

Next, we compare the means of each pair of seasons.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

\begin{verbatim}

## summer-winter 124.901668 115.26026 134.5430748 0.0000000
## fall-winter    87.754288  77.96798  97.5405970 0.0000000
## summer-spring  27.672168  18.12517  37.2191613 0.0000000
## fall-spring    -9.475213 -19.16852   0.2180949 0.0581801
## fall-summer   -37.147380 -46.79465 -27.5001142 0.0000000
\end{verbatim}

From the Tukey method, all the pairs are statistically different except
the fall-spring pair. This confirms the visual in the box plot, where we
see similar distributions in fall and spring.

We can see by the above given boxplot, that the data appears to be
evenly spread out between each weekday and across all the seasons. This
shows that in general each day will yield approximately the same number
of riders, which will help increase our profit. The question though is
do we see a difference between casual and registered users.

\begin{center}\includegraphics{Progress-Report_files/figure-latex/casual_vs_registered-1} \end{center}

We can see above that the majority of the \texttt{casual} user's usage
is on the weekend, and the registered user uses them consistently
throughout the week. This indicates that we might need to look at
different models depending on the user type. We might see a little more
non-linearity with casual users than with the registered users.

\hypertarget{ongoing-work}{%
\section{Ongoing Work}\label{ongoing-work}}

Anticipated challenges:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Distinguishing between the influences of weather and the influence of
  the season, particularly on casual usage. DC has many visitors in
  Spring and Summer who would show up under the casual response
  variable.
\item
  Accounting for the overall increase in usage over the two years
  spanning our dataset. The dataset was collected towards the beginning
  of the Capital Bikeshare program, so findings we draw from the overall
  increasing usage would not necessarily translate directly to mature
  systems.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{literature-review-summary}{%
\section{Literature Review Summary}\label{literature-review-summary}}

Existing literature around bikeshare usage generally emphasizes the
following:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Time of day is typically the most important predictor, but different
  days of the week have different trends based on time of day
\item
  Specifically, usage is often bimodal on weekdays reflecting commuter
  patterns
\item
  Usage is not bimodal on weekends, typically with the highest value in
  mid-afternoon.
\item
  Usage increases as temperature increases, then starts to decrease as
  temperatures go into the 90s (Fahrenheit), which can be too hot
\item
  Precipitation of any amount discourages cycling
\item
  High humidity has a negative effect on cycling
\item
  High winds can have a negative effect on cycling
\item
  Usage is often higher in spring and summer, and lowest in winter
\end{itemize}
