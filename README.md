# Python Scripts to Scrape and Aggregate Data

* Consider setting up a virtual environment first.
* Install necessary packages by running `pip install requirements.txt`
* In the `Other Resources` directory, first run `get_bikeshare_data.py`, then run `join_data.py`. This will retrieve additional years of bikeshare data and add historical weather data.

# R Scripts for Data Cleaning and Analysis
* There are two subfolders with the R scripts, both located in the 'Code' directory. 

In the 'Model' subfolder:
* Run `Combinedmodels.R` and `regression_models.R`, `time_series_models.R` ,`prohpet_model.R` and `sarima_model.R` to see different models.

In the 'EDA' subfolder:
* Run `EDA_plots.R` and `EDA.R` to see models and visuals used in exploratory data analysis
